This repository is the official algorithm implementation of our paper, <strong>REACT3D</strong>, published in MICRO 2025. It implements the "Spatial Consistency and Convergence Aware Sparsification" algorithm for 3DGS SLAM, designed to accelerate the real-time training on edge devices. This code is built upon the excellent work of <a href=""><strong>Gaussian Splatting SLAM (MonoGS)</strong></a> (CVPR 2024 Highlight).

The code is coming soon.
